//Here we are going to learn about function 
//function is nothing but a piece of code where it will only going to get execute when we call them 
//whenever we run any code the first thing which executed is the main function 

#include<iostream>

{
	//whenever we write anything here the compiler first comes and call the main fucntion and whatever code is residing inside this curly braces it starts to execute them
